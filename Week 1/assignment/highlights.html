        Origins
    </h1>
    <p>
        Chess has a long history. It can be traced back nearly 1600 years to its origins in our very own India. &#128515; It was called "Chaturanga"; literally translating to four divisions (of the military): the infantry, the elephants, the calvalry and the chariots which in today's chess are represented by the pawns, the bishops, the knights and the rooks respectively.
        It then spread to Persia where the game was known by the name "Chatrang". This resembles the name "Shatrang" which many of us know today. The rules changed during this time; players started calling "Shah!" (Persian for "King!") when attacking the opponent's king and "Shah Mat" (Persian for "The King is helpless &#128560; ") when the king was attacked and couldn't escaped(Checkmate).

         The game was taken up by the Muslim world after the early Arab Muslims conquered the Sassanid Empire, with the pieces largely keeping their Persian names. Muslims brought chess to North Africa, Sicily, and Spain by the 10th century. Chess spread directly from Middle East to Russia, where it was known as шахматы ("Shahmaty") from the Persian "Shah Mat". In the East, carried by Buddhist pilgrims, Silk Road traders, and others, it was transformed into a game with inscribed disks that were often placed on the intersection of the lines of the board rather than within the squares.

        This increase in the ability of queen and bishop led to pawn promotion being significant.
        Global trade eventually brought the game to Europe. The social value attached to the game - seen as a prestigious pastime associated with nobility and high culture , is clear from the expensive and exquisitely made chessboards of the medieval era. Chess and dice games were periodically banned by kings and religious leaders. For example, King Louis IX forbade the game in France in 1254 because gambling money on chess games became widespread. and around 1200CE the game undertook dramatic changes to become what it is today.  In Italy and Spain, such changes gave their pawns the ability to move two squares on the first move, bishops their dominance over diagnals and queens their ability to move anywhere.

        The two major changes in the rules - en-passant capture and castling were known in the 15th century but had limited acceptance and usage till the 18th century.
        In modern age, the queen can't play knight's moves but in some areas that was the case for a long time. &#128558; Writings about the chess theory appeared in the late 15th century.  The <i>Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez </i>(Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess) by Spanish churchman Luis Ramírez de Lucena was published in Salamanca in 1497. Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro Damiano, Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona, Giulio Cesare Polerio and Gioachino Greco, and Spanish bishop Ruy López de Segura developed elements of opening theory and started to analyze simple endgames. Those are some popular names in the history of chess and even today, some famous opening moves are named after them.

    <h1>
        Romantic era
    </h1>
    <p>
        In the 18th century, the center of European chess life moved from Southern Europe to mainland France.Centers of chess activity in this period were coffee houses in major European cities like Café de la Régence in Paris and Simpson's Divan in London.
        During this time, the intellectual movement of Romanticism began to have an impact on chess. In Romantic chess, the objective was to sacrifice pieces in order to launch an attack. The game was played more for art than theory. Romantic players frequently played aggressive openings like the King's Gambit, the Danish Gambit, and the Evans Gambit, which aren't the best according to today's knowledge of chess. It was considered unsporting to decline a gambit, and the Romantic era of chess was marked by open games with more tactical opportunities than positional ones. The Romantic era of chess was followed by the Scientific, Hypermodern, and New Dynamism eras.
        Here are some of the most famous games from that era:

        <p>The game was played between Anderssen, considered to be the best player in the world at the time, and Jean Dufresne in 1852. Dufresne was not a world-class player but was a popular chess author.The game has been analyzed extensively over the years. It was in the year 1879, that Wilhelm Steinitz gave the game its name when he described it as "an evergreen in the laurel crown of the departed chess hero."  </p>

        <p>The game was played between Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky between rounds of the first international tournament, which was held in London in 1851. Anderssen won this tournament and became regarded as the strongest player in the world. The Immortal Game is important because it is a paradigm of romantic play, it displays multiple fantastic sacrifices and has an unforgettable checkmating pattern.</p>
        <p>Adolf Anderssen was a German Chess Master.He won the great international tournaments of 1851 and 1862. Anderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament. He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50. But he did lose to Paul Morphy, another legend of the chess. Paul Morphy was American and beat Anderssen in 1858 by a score of 7-2 (they also played 2 draws). Below is the game number 9 of the 11 played between them, insane attacking miniature by Morphy.</p>

        Birth of a Sport (Before WW2)
    </h1>
    <p>
        Prague-born Wilhelm Steinitz laid the foundations for a scientific approach to the game, the art of breaking a position down into components and preparing correct plans. Steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading German master Johannes Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship. This win marked a stylistic transition at the highest levels of chess from an attacking, tactical style predominant in the Romantic era to a more positional, strategic style introduced to the chess world by Steinitz.
        After the end of the 19th century, the number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew.
        A prodigy from Cuba, José Raúl Capablanca, known for his skill in endgames, won the World Championship from Lasker in 1921. Capablanca was undefeated in tournament play for eight years, from 1916 to 1924. His successor (1927) was the Russian-French Alexander Alekhine, a strong attacking player who died as the world champion in 1946. Alekhine briefly lost the title to Dutch player Max Euwe in 1935 and regained it two years later.
        Some sources state that in 1914 the title of chess grandmaster was first formally conferred by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia (Russian Revolution ki yaad aayi na &#128514;) to Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Tarrasch and Marshall, but this is a disputed claim.

        After the death of Alekhine, a new World Champion was sought in a tournament of elite players ruled by FIDE, who have controlled the title since then, with a sole interruption. The winner of this tournament was the Russian Mikhail Botvinnik.
        This marked the beginning of an era of dominance of Soviet Union in the chess world. 
        He won the world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in 1951 and 1954. In 1957, he lost to Vasily Smyslov, but regained the title in a rematch in 1958. In 1960, he lost the title to the 23-year-old Latvian prodigy Mikhail Tal, an accomplished tactician and attacking player who is widely regarded as one of the most creative players ever, hence his nickname "the magician from Riga". 

        Both The Mammoth Book of the World's Greatest Chess Games and Modern Chess Brilliancies include more games by Tal than any other player. Below is one of the many games played by "Misha"

            Botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in 1961.
            Tigran Petrosian then won the title from Botvinnik in 1963 and successfully defended till 1969 when he lost to Boris Spassky.  In 1972, Spassky was defeated by Bobby Fischer, a native of the United States.Fischer defeated his opponents in the Candidates matches by unheard-of margins, and convincingly defeated Spassky for the world championship. The match was followed closely by news media of the day, leading to a surge in popularity for chess; it also held significant political importance at the height of the Cold War, with the match being seen by both sides as a microcosm of the conflict between East and West. Until the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there was only one non-Soviet champion, American Bobby Fischer (champion 1972-1975). Fischer refused to defend the title against Anatoly Karpov in 1975, so Karpov became the world champion by default. Karpov defended his title twice against Viktor Korchnoi and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with a string of tournament successes.
